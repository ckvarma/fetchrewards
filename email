Communication with stakeholder

To answer this question, i am sending this message to my Senior Manager who is in constant touch with business stakeholders to shed the light and grab the answers to address the issues. 

Subject: Data qualities and anomalies within Brands, Users, Receipts datasets.

Hello Mark, 

After working on the datasets for a while, I have come up with questions regarding date quality, gathering we needs answers for to go ahead. 

To start, several questions have arisen regarding data completeness, accuracy, and consistency. Some of the questions I have include:

What are the main sources of the data, and how frequently is it updated and regulated?
Are there any data validation processes in place to ensure data integrity?
Is there any data loss occurring when migrating between systems, as some data is being captured while half is missing?
How do we handle missing or incomplete data points across different datasets, and are there any known biases in the data that we need to be aware of?
The data quality issues were identified through a systematic review and analysis of the datasets.

During this process, I employed various data profiling techniques, including examining summary statistics. 
Additionally, I analyzed data deeply and looked for inconsistencies or discrepancies.
This proactive approach allowed me to uncover anomalies, missing values, and inconsistencies that may affect the reliability and accuracy of our analyses. 
Below are a few examples of my findings:

Signup Source Anomalies: The presence of null values in the 'signUpSource' column for users who signed up before 2017 could hinder our understanding of platform preferences during signup.
Addressing this could shed light on user behavior trends.
Missing Last Login Dates: Null values in the 'Last_login_date' column may indicate missed data capture opportunities, impacting our ability to track user engagement effectively. 
Investigating the reasons behind these gaps could lead to more accurate insights.
Data Redundancy in Categories and Brand Codes: There appears to be duplication between 'Category' & 'Category_code' and 'name' & 'Brandcode' columns. 
Consolidating these could streamline data management processes and improve clarity in our analysis.
Incomplete Transaction Records: Null values in essential columns such as 'purchaseDate', 'barcode', and 'brandCode' raise questions about data completeness and accuracy. 
Understanding the root cause behind these gaps is crucial for ensuring the reliability of our transaction data.
To address these issues, I believe a thorough revamp of the data collection and processing would help us understand the missing gaps in the data assets. 
This should highlight the areas where and how data is being missed coming into the system. I believe this would also resolve the missing relations between the datasets.

As we continue to grow, for our futuristic outlook, seamless database scaling is crucial as user and transaction volumes increase. 
Continuous monitoring of infrastructure is vital for scalability. 
To address missing data, I highly recommend refined data capture methods and strategies to fill the missing values. 
Dynamic data relationships are key for accurate analysis. Ensure application security with continuous monitoring and encryption. 
Conduct thorough reviews, streamline data management, and enhance completeness and accuracy. 
Continuous investments in performance and scalability enhancements for future growth will highly benefit the data management.

Thank you for considering these insights. I look forward to discussing these matters further and implementing solutions to enhance our data quality and management.

Best,
Chaitanya
